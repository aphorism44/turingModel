These programs create a set of increasingly complex programming languages, all of which reduce to a standard Turing Machine (*tmModule.js*).

The "Wang" languages are taken from Stanford's CS103 class, *Mathematical Foundations of Computing*. The lecture slides are here: https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs103/cs103.1132/lectures/19/Slides19.pdf.

The purpose of the lecture was to demonstrate the Church-Turing Thesis. My personal motives for actually creating these languages was to see this thesis at work, and watch a normal programming language "compile" down to a Turing Machine.

I also used Charles Petzold's *The Annotated Turing* (http://theannotatedturing.com/).
